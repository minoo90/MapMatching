# MapMatching: A method for matching vehicles GPS data on the digital roads network map

The map matching uses both Digital Road Network (DRN) topology and spatial relations. It matches GPS tracks to roads. In this work, the OpenStreetMap digital road network of the city of Seattle was extracted and used for DRN. Trajectory dataset comprises a vehicle’s GPS data that has latitude, longitude, time, speed, and heading. The sampling rate of the GPS dataset is every second of the mentioned vehicle’s travel during a day. 
Three main functions are used in this work: Initial road and location detection (IMP), following up a vehicle alongside the current road (SMP1), detecting and locating the vehicle on a road when it crosses an intersection (SMP2). 
Different sets of fuzzy logic rules are needed for each aforementioned function to achieve an optimized speed for the algorithm. Therefore, a corresponding zero-order Sugeno Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) is developed for each function. The code is implemented in Rstudio 3.4.
